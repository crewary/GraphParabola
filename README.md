GraphParabola
=============

Graphs a parabola with your settings of how large to set window and number of points to use. Needs DrawingPanel class to work.



REQUIREMENTS: This program will ask for the coefficients of a quadratic, and using the window settings of the class variables
will plot out the graph in a drawing panel that opens with a varying window size depending on window of x and y values set
as well as list values in a table from the other window set by the class variables.
The final window size can then finally be rescaled by changing "wholeScale"


IMPLEMENTATION: This program meets the requirements through one main method, where it takes the values input for coefficients manually by user
and returns doubles guided by the window settings in which can be then plotted, and/or listed in the table format.
